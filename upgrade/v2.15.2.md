# MainNet v2.15.0 -> v2.15.2 Upgrade Instructions

The following instructions will allow patch your node from v2.15.0 to v2.15.2

**:exclamation: Run these steps in sequence, do not skip any steps! :exclamation:**

1. Download and upgrade using the v2.15.2 release bundle.

    The [v2.15.2 release bundle](https://github.com/Switcheo/carbon-bootstrap/releases/tag/v2.15.2) contains v2.15.2 binaries.

    We will be placing v2.15.2 binaries (`carbond`) in the `cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.15.0` directory. 

    ```bash
    VERSION=2.15.2
    MINOR=2.15.0
    NETWORK=mainnet
    FILE=carbond${VERSION}-${NETWORK}.linux-$(dpkg --print-architecture).tar.gz
    wget https://github.com/Switcheo/carbon-bootstrap/releases/download/v${VERSION}/${FILE}
    tar -xvf ${FILE}
    rm ${FILE}
    sudo service carbond stop
    mv carbond ~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v${MINOR}/bin/carbond
    carbond rollback && sudo service carbond restart
    ```

2. Check that you have configured the right versions of `carbond`.

    Ensure that you have the right binaries installed under the `cosmovisor` directory:

    ```bash
    openssl sha256 ~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.15.0/bin/carbond
    # arm64 
    # amd64 
    ```
