**:exclamation: Run these steps in sequence, do not skip any steps! :exclamation:**

1. Download and upgrade using the v2.16.1 release bundle.

    The [v2.16.1 release bundle](https://github.com/Switcheo/carbon-bootstrap/releases/tag/v2.16.1) contains v2.16.1 binaries.

    We will be placing v2.16.1 binaries (`carbond`) in the `cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.16.0` directory.

    ```bash
    VERSION=2.16.1
    MINOR=2.16.0
    NETWORK=mainnet
    FILE=carbond${VERSION}-${NETWORK}.linux-$(dpkg --print-architecture).tar.gz
    wget https://github.com/Switcheo/carbon-bootstrap/releases/download/v${VERSION}/${FILE}
    tar -xvf ${FILE}
    rm ${FILE}
    sudo service carbond stop
    mv carbond ~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v${MINOR}/bin/carbond
    sudo service carbond start
    ```

2. Check that you have configured the right versions of `carbond`.

    Ensure that you have the right binaries installed under the `cosmovisor` directory:

    ```bash
    openssl sha256 ~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.16.0/bin/carbond
    # arm64 45d9735afd4d9a8ef994048197f2ebd3e7d42c436d15a2203f7b30ac1f8bdaf7
    # amd64 b9db01c46abfffcf50d66da7057dbb92a90dfc584b7c6dc50650fde29a19287f
    ```
