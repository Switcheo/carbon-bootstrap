# MainNet v2.36.x -> v2.36.9 Upgrade Instructions

The following instructions will allow patch your node from v2.36.x to v2.36.9 to correct `~/.carbond/data/snapshots` folder. Prior to this snapshots folder was hardcoded to leveldb database, it now uses the `db_backend` specified in `~/.carbon/config/config.toml`

**:exclamation: Run these steps in sequence, do not skip any steps! :exclamation:**

1. Download and upgrade using the v2.36.9 release bundle. Delete snapshots folder.

    The [v2.36.9 release bundle](https://github.com/Switcheo/carbon-bootstrap/releases/tag/v2.36.9) contains v2.36.9 binaries.

    We will be placing v2.36.9 binaries (`carbond`) in the `cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.36.0` directory.

    ```bash
    VERSION=2.36.9
    MINOR=2.36.0
    NETWORK=mainnet
    FILE=carbond${VERSION}-${NETWORK}.linux-$(dpkg --print-architecture).tar.gz
    wget https://github.com/Switcheo/carbon-bootstrap/releases/download/v${VERSION}/${FILE}
    tar -xvf ${FILE}
    rm ${FILE}
    sudo service carbond stop
    mv carbond ~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v${MINOR}/bin/carbond
    rm -rf ~/.carbon/data/snapshots/
    sudo service carbond start
    ```

2. Check that you have configured the right versions of `carbond`.

    Ensure that you have the right binaries installed under the `cosmovisor` directory:

    ```bash
    openssl sha256 ~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.36.0/bin/carbond
    # arm64 2bd32e4e69365a4f2241b8300b83b9ab90aedceee0a9f1221dd5d847adcc94ca
    # amd64 5d589bb19e52bc579f3d31fb85cffada46ef900e6eb186a8bce3d2d7fe9f17d1
    ```
