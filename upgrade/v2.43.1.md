# MainNet v2.43.0 -> v2.43.1 Pre-Upgrade Instructions

The following instructions will allow patch your node from v2.43.0 to v2.43.1.

1. Run the following commands to generate ssl configurations, that will be used to authenticate GRPC server.

    **:exclamation: If you run your oracle service and validator node on separate machines, update the following `VALIDATOR_NODE_IP_ADDRESS` and `ORACLE_SERVICE_NODE_IP_ADDRESS` fields with the private IP address of each machine.:exclamation:**

    ```bash
    VALIDATOR_NODE_IP_ADDRESS="127.0.0.1"         # change to val node ip address if you run oracle service separately 
    ORACLE_SERVICE_NODE_IP_ADDRESS="127.0.0.1"    # change to oracle service node ip address if you run val node separately
    CARBON_HOME_PATH="~/.carbon"                  # change to your own directory path where the .carbon directory is found
    URL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yan-soon/carbon-bootstrap/master/scripts/cert.sh
    bash <(wget -O - $URL) $VALIDATOR_NODE_IP_ADDRESS $ORACLE_SERVICE_NODE_IP_ADDRESS $CARBON_HOME_PATH
    ```

2. Update your oracle.json config in `~/.carbon/config/app.toml`, under `gRPC Configuration`.
    
    Set the following field `disable-oracle-grpc-auth` to `true`:

    ```
    # DisableOracleGrpcAuth defines if the gRPC server for oracle votes communication should be ssl authenticated.
    disable-oracle-grpc-auth = true
    ```

    Restart both your oracle service and validator node if they are running.
