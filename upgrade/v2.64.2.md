# MainNet v2.64.0 -> v2.64.2 Upgrade Instructions

The following instructions will allow patch your node from v2.64.0 to v2.64.2 to fix a bug in the oracle service.
If you are using an oracle-delegate to submit oracle votes, do make sure to patch the oracle service node instead.

**:exclamation: Run these steps in sequence, do not skip any steps! :exclamation:**

1. Download and upgrade using the v2.64.2 release bundle.

    The [v2.64.2 release bundle](https://github.com/Switcheo/carbon-bootstrap/releases/tag/v2.64.2) contains v2.64.2 binaries.

    We will be placing v2.64.2 binaries (`carbond`) in the `cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.64.0` directory.

    ```bash
    VERSION=2.64.2
    MINOR=2.64.0
    NETWORK=mainnet
    FILE=carbond${VERSION}-${NETWORK}.linux-$(dpkg --print-architecture).tar.gz
    wget https://github.com/Switcheo/carbon-bootstrap/releases/download/v${VERSION}/${FILE}
    tar -xvf ${FILE}
    rm ${FILE}
    sudo service carbond stop
    mv carbond ~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v${MINOR}/bin/carbond
    sudo service carbond start
    ```

2. Check that you have configured the right versions of `carbond`.

    Ensure that you have the right binaries installed under the `cosmovisor` directory:

    ```bash
    openssl sha256 ~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.64.0/bin/carbond
    # arm64 90fe83eee39711470dbad402195eb8481ca4263a4994c1776dcb36ed4ebfe35d
    # amd64 0b50de003a661d73f7fb656dd1f6343116bb7692cbff96ce750613f22a6236e1
    ```
