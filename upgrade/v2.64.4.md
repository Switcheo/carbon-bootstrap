**:exclamation: Run these steps in sequence, do not skip any steps! :exclamation:**

1. Download and upgrade using the v2.64.4 release bundle.

   The [v2.64.4 release bundle](https://github.com/Switcheo/carbon-bootstrap/releases/tag/v2.64.4) contains v2.64.4 binaries.

   We will be placing v2.64.4 binaries (`carbond`) in the `cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.64.0` directory.

   ```bash
   VERSION=2.64.4
   MINOR=2.64.0
   NETWORK=mainnet
   FILE=carbond${VERSION}-${NETWORK}.linux-$(dpkg --print-architecture).tar.gz
   wget https://github.com/Switcheo/carbon-bootstrap/releases/download/v${VERSION}/${FILE}
   tar -xvf ${FILE}
   rm ${FILE}
   sudo service carbond stop
   mv carbond ~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v${MINOR}/bin/carbond
   sudo service carbond start
   ```

2. Check that you have configured the right versions of `carbond`.

   Ensure that you have the right binaries installed under the `cosmovisor` directory:

   ```bash
   openssl sha256 ~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.64.0/bin/carbond
   # arm64 1248a4451a045e92393c1c88f476ad5bd413b9b9ffb729a4c45f4bc405ef1761
   # amd64 baf8ee9e56d808968d811b45babf658dd09a5b54a1c43644045a1eaf1edbf2d7
   ```
